A 3D snake game where the snake grows by eating blocks, avoids enemies, and dies if it hits itself—set across 3 levels: open plains with slow enemies, a maze with chasers, and sky platforms with falling hazards and projectiles.
There will be two camera mode.  Third person view and first person view. In third person view there will be 3 levels with environmental  obstacles (level -1 walls, level 2- holes, level 3 - enemies) where the snake grows to a certain size and eats a powerup to move on to the next level. But in first person view the snake will move forward with no environment obstacles and the enemies will come in its direction and with time the speed will increase and the snake will grow longer with each powerup eaten. 
Powerups will include invisibility for a certain period of time, double scores, short snake for a certain amount of time, etc
